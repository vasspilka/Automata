**Automata** is an editor for deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata
(DFA, NFA, NFAε). It is an open source web application aimed to help students
and educators better understand and explain the concepts of computation in
theoretical computer science university departments.

The Automata tool was developed at the [Computer Science](http://corelab.ntua.gr/) division of the
[Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ntua.gr/) department at the [National Technical
University of Athens](http://www.ntua.gr/), but is aimed at academic institutions wordwide.

We're looking to add several features. If you feel like contributing, just go ahead and do a pull request with your patch.

Some ideas for the future:

 * Login with Gmail to keep a list of your automata
 * Conversion from automaton to grammar and back
 * Conversion from automaton to regular expression and back
 * NFA to DFA conversion
 * Automaton minimization

Deployment
==========

For apache with wsgi_mod and Python 2.7

First configure your application.

    $ cd (Automata_path)
    $ cp backend/config.example.py backend/config.py
    $ vim backend/config.py

Then run setup.py

    $ python backend/setup.py

Finally configure apache with wsgi.
You should put something like this to your host at `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/(site)`

     <VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerName automata.discrete.gr
         DocumentRoot /var/www/discrete.gr/automata
         WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/discrete.gr/automata/backend/server.wsgi
     </VirtualHost>

For development ignore the last step and run `cd backend && python server.py` from root folder.
